# Juggle Mail

![cover](cover.png)

Ludum Dare 53 has happened. It is time to deliver the news!

Do that in style by juggling the newspapers for higher score!

[**PLAY THE GAME on itch.io**](https://kuviman.itch.io/juggle-mail)

You get score slowly by doing nothing, or by shooting newspapers into mailboxes. Score you get is getting multiplied by the number of newspapers you are juggling.

Thats all the rules!
